1. T it is at most logarithmic search
2. F will be less than log(N) growth
3. F not on order of linear growth
4. T it is bounded on top by linear growth rate
5. T is bounded on top by exponential 
6. T as mentioned in class
7. F they are bounded on top by log(N)
8. O(N^2) make N calls where N is height (approx log(N))
